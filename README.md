## 📌 Overview of the Project

**Project**: Handwritten Digit Recognizer

### 🎯 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can recognize handwritten digits from images. The system uses image processing and classification techniques to accurately predict digits from 0 to 9 using datasets such as MNIST.

### 🛠️ Key Activities

- **Data Preprocessing**: Normalizing and reshaping image data.
- **Model Training**: Building and training a neural network using Keras or TensorFlow.
- **Evaluation**: Measuring accuracy and performance on test data.
- **Prediction**: Taking user input or image samples to predict digits.

### 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- NumPy, Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)  
- Jupyter Notebook
